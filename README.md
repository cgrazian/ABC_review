# ABC_review
This is the code for the paper "A review of Approximate Bayesian Computation:inference for simulator-models" by Grazian and Fan (2019)

There are several files:

normal_data.csv            :      this is the data used in the paper for the normal example
normal_example.ipynb       :      this is the code (as Jupyter notebook) for the normal example, for synthetic likelihood, standard ABC and BOLFI


ricker_data.csv            :      this is the data used in the paper for the example involving the Ricker model
Ricker_example.ipynb       :      this is the code (as Jupyter notebook) for the example involving the Ricker model, for synthetic likelihood, standard ABC and BOLFI
